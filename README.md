# Hotel-Rooms-Management-System
A Console based Java Application to help the guests to book their rooms in a Hotel based on their own choices
A new room booking system is required to help guests reserve a room based on the following requirements: 
Single, Double or Suite.
With or Without Balcony.
With or Without Lounge.
When a suitable match is found, the guests should be able to reserve the room. Room reservations may also be cancelled. The room data should be stored in a file rooms.txt that will contain the room data and any reservations, though initially every room should be unreserved. Upon application launch, the data should be loaded into appropriate data structures and upon application exit, the data should be saved back to the file.
